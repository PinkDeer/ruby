Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it.
Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when you view the page).
Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing.
Once fetched, then extraction can take place.
The content of a page may be parsed, searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet, and so on. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be to find and copy names and phone numbers, or companies and their URLs, to a list (contact scraping).
